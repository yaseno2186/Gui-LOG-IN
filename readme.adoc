== Features

* Input fields for username and password.
* Validation of username and password input.
* Feedback message for successful login or input errors.
* Exit button to close the application.

== Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

== Running the Application

1. Compile the Java source code:

    ```
    javac Gui.java
    ```

2. Run the compiled Java program:

    ```
    java Gui
    ```

3. The GUI window will appear, allowing you to enter a username and password.

== Application Flow

* `Gui()`: The constructor that sets up the GUI components and their behavior.
* `name`: A JTextField for the username input.
* `pass`: A JPasswordField for the password input.
* `msg`: A JLabel for displaying messages to the user.
* `error`: A boolean flag indicating if there is an input error.
* `main(String[] args)`: The main method that starts the application.
* Input validation for the username and password fields.
* Action listeners for the "Enter" and "Exit" buttons.

== Example
